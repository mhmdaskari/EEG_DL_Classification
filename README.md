# EEG_DL_Classification
This repository inlcudes our implementation of Naive CNN, Naive LSTM, GAN + CNN, and CNN + LSTM in TensorFlow for EEG-based task classification.

* All analyzes are done on Google Colab using TPUs.
* We could use more epochs for CNN-LSTM model to get higher accuracy, but we stopped after 100 epochs.

This project is done as a part of C247 - Deep Learning and Neural Networks course at UCLA on Winter 2023.
